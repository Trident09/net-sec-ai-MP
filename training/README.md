# **Training Scripts Subfolder**

This folder contains all necessary files and scripts to train the machine learning model for the project.

## **Contents**
1. **`train.py`**  
   The main script for training the machine learning model. It includes:
   - Data preprocessing
   - Model initialization
   - Training and evaluation
   - Saving the trained model for future use

2. **Dependencies**  
   The following Python libraries are required to run the training script:
   - `pandas`: For data manipulation
   - `numpy`: For numerical computations
   - `scikit-learn`: For machine learning models and utilities
   - `joblib`: For saving and loading models

3. **Expected Input**  
   The script expects the dataset in a specific format (e.g., CSV). Please ensure the input data meets the following criteria:
   - File format: `.csv`
   - Contains the necessary features and target labels as defined in the script.

4. **Output**  
   The training script produces:
   - A trained model saved as a `.joblib` file.
   - Performance metrics displayed in the console (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix).

## **Setup**

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**
Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8 or later). Install the required libraries using `pip`:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib
```

If you're using a virtual environment, activate it and then install the dependencies:
```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate          # On Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib
```

### **Step 2: Place the Dataset**
Ensure your dataset is available in the expected format and location. By default, the script looks for a dataset file (e.g., `data.csv`) in the same directory. Update the script to reflect the dataset path if it is stored elsewhere.

---

## **How to Run the Script**

Run the training script using the following command:
```bash
python train.py --data_path <path_to_your_dataset>
```

### **Optional Arguments**
- `--data_path`: Path to the dataset file (default: `data.csv`)
- Additional arguments can be added as needed and updated in this section.

---

## **File Descriptions**
- **`train.py`**: Contains the full training pipeline, including preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`<output_model.joblib>`**: The trained model, saved after running the script.
- **`<log_files>`** (if applicable): Any logs or outputs generated during the training process.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Errors**
1. **Library Not Found:**  
   Ensure all required libraries are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Dataset Issues:**  
   Verify the dataset file exists and is formatted correctly. Update the script's `data_path` argument if necessary.

### **Debugging**
For debugging, use print statements or a debugger like `pdb` to trace errors in the script.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Add support for additional model architectures.
- Include hyperparameter tuning using tools like `GridSearchCV`.
- Extend the script to log metrics to a file or dashboard.
